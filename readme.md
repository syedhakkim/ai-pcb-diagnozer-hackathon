# AI PCB Diagnozer

AI PCB Diagnozer is an AI-assisted diagnostic platform designed to help laptop and desktop repair technicians identify motherboard faults quickly and accurately using impedance analysis, symptom selection, and repair intelligence data.

##  Problem Statement

Motherboard repair is highly dependent on technician experience. Fault diagnosis often involves trial-and-error testing, leading to:

- Long repair turnaround times  
- Misdiagnosis and repeated failures  
- High service costs  
- Limited access to schematics and BIOS files  
- Knowledge gaps in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities  

There is currently no intelligent system that combines impedance analysis, board recognition, and historical repair intelligence into one structured platform.

## Solution Overview

AI PCB Diagnozer provides:

- AI-based impedance anomaly detection  
- Symptom-driven fault analysis  
- Automatic fault area recommendation  
- Red-box highlighting of suspected PCB regions  
- Board & IC part number recognition (OCR-based)  
- Integrated schematics, BIOS, and IC datasheet access  
- Personal diagnostic history tracking  

The system transforms traditional trial-and-error
